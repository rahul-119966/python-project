# Year Calender (Python)
The calendar is a utility interface which is made from python programming using graphic user interface via Tkinter. In this interface,
we create a simple calendar which calculates the day according to the date in a random year which is selected by the user. To calculate the required day, the Zellerâ€™s Algorithm is used. The interface is coded in Python 3.6.1 and Tkinter module is imported to patch the GUI.
